# Calculator

Basic calculator with HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript 

Based off of tutorials and ChatGPT was used for help and formatting as well as commenting 

It's not fully functioning currently, as it still needs the base necessities to be called a "calculator" but i already added some unneccesary easter eggs.
